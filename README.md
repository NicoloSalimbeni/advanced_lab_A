# Measurement of the muon spin
The experiment consists in the design and realization of an experiment to determine the magnetic moment of muons of cosmic origin. The cosmic (polarized) muons are stopped in a copper target immersed in a magnetic field B (uniform and well known) that causes the decaying muon spin to precede (since the muon stops and until the muon decays).

The main goal of the experience is the measurement of the angular distribution of the positrons (detected through the delayed coincidence technique) whose flight direction is correlated with the direction of the parent muon spin as a consequence of the parity violation in the decay. The magnetic moment of the muon can be deduced from the measured precession frequency. The detectors used are scintillators, readout by silicon photomultipliers. Front-end electronics can be built by students. The microcontroller-based acquisition system can be programmed entirely by students. Crucial for the success of the experiment will be the timing calibrations of the detectors, the design of a coil suitable for having the most uniform magnetic field and the accurate measurement of the magnetic field map. The data analysis is complemented by a comparison with a Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment, which will also be used during the phase related to the design of the setup.
