# Measurement of the muon spin
The experiment involves conceptualizing and executing a design to measure the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of a cosmic muon. Polarized cosmic muons are stopped within a copper target positioned in a uniform and precisely known magnetic field. This magnetic field induces a precession in the spin of the decaying muon from the moment it comes to a stop until its eventual decay.

The main goal of the experience is the measurement of the angular distribution of the positrons (detected through the delayed coincidence technique) whose flight direction is correlated with the direction of the parent muon spin as a consequence of the parity violation in the decay. The magnetic moment of the muon can be deduced from the measured precession frequency. The detectors used are scintillators, readout by silicon photomultipliers. Front-end electronics can be built by students. The microcontroller-based acquisition system can be programmed entirely by students. Crucial for the success of the experiment will be the timing calibrations of the detectors, the design of a coil suitable for having the most uniform magnetic field and the accurate measurement of the magnetic field map. The data analysis is complemented by a comparison with a Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment, which will also be used during the phase related to the design of the setup.
